FFTW is disabled for the examples in this folder. Only CUDA code with downsampling is being tested for sizes equal to and larger than 1024 x 1024 x 1024


1. To run on the Bridges AI allocation, use: 
interact -A cc5fpap -p GPU-AI --gres=gpu:volta32:1 

2. Then, if the executable has not been made,do :
module avail cuda
make


3. Inside your interactive session or your batch job  you must first issue the command
module load singularity


4. Then to execute, open a singularity shell
singularity shell --nv /pylon5/containers/ngc/tensorflow/19.05-py3.simg

5. Then, execute the bash script which will execute the massif.x. Do the following:
./run_code.sh



### ANOTHER try

1. interact with GPU compute node


2. do "module load singularity"

3. then use the command " singularity run --nv /pylon5/containers/ngc/tensorflow/19.05-py3.simg"

4. see the message there that NVIDIA driver was not loaded
