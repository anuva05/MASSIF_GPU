FFTW is disabled for the examples in this folder. Only CUDA code with downsampling is being tested for sizes equal to and larger than 1024 x 1024 x 1024


1. To run on the Bridges AI allocation, use: 
interact -A cc5fpap -p GPU-AI --gres=gpu:volta32:1 

2. Then, if the executable has not been made,do :
module avail cuda
make


3. Inside your interactive session or your batch job  you must first issue the command
module load singularity


4. Then to execute, open a singularity shell
singularity shell --nv /pylon5/containers/ngc/tensorflow/19.05-py3.simg

5. Then, execute the bash script which will execute the massif.x. Do the following:
./run_code.sh



### ANOTHER try

1. interact with GPU compute node


2. do "module load singularity"" and "module load cuda"

3. then use the command "singularity exec --nv /pylon5/containers/ngc/tensorflow/tensorflow_20.06-tf2-py3.sif ./massif.x

In order to see GPU usage as well, do:
singularity exec --nv /pylon5/containers/ngc/tensorflow/tensorflow_20.06-tf2-py3.sif ./massif.x | watch nvidia-smi

So far it seems largest size:
2048, 2048, 2048
k=64
ds = 64
b=512
