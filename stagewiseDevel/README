Developing massif pipeline in stages.
First stage involved writing functions to compare CUFFT output with FFTW. 
Then, we moved on to develop the CUFFT approach for 2-stage FFT computation over a 3D volume, by doing 1D transform followed by 2D transform.
Then, callbacks were introduced. Initially the callbacks only zero-ed out the samples that we did not want to keep. The next stages focused on removing the samples so that memory footprint would be reduced.
Single precision code showed more mismatch with FFTW values even for magnitudes of the order of 10e-5. Hence, we are sticking to double precision.
